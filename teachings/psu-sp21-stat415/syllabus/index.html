<h3 id="course-objective">Course Objective</h3>
<p>This course serves as an introduction to mathematical statistics, covering the fundamentals of statistical inference. In this course, students will learn the mathematical foundations of statistical inference and how to perform statistical inference procedures to solve practical problems.
Topics include, but are not limited to, point estimation, likelihood theory, sufficiency, interval estimation, hypothesis testing, linear models, analysis of variance and Bayesian estimation.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Students must have completed MATH/STAT 414 at enrollment. This course assumes familiarity with college-level calculus, linear algebra and probability theory. The statistical software, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a>, will be used throughout the class. No previous knowledge of the computer programming or the software is required; though prior experience in programming would be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="course-staff-information">Course Staff Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor:</strong> Dr. Hyebin Song, Assistant Professor</li>
<li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:hps5320@psu.edu">hps5320@psu.edu</a></li>
<li><strong>Office Hours:</strong> Tuesday , Friday 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM, Friday 4:00 - 5:00 PM</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://psu.zoom.us/j/9663524933">Zoom</a></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h2>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>Probability  and  Statistical  Inference (10th edition) by Hogg,  Tanis  and  Zimmerman  (Pearson,  2019). Previous editions will be fine.</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>R</code>: download for free at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</a></li>
<li><code>RStudio</code>(IDE): download for free at <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Students are allowed to use other programming languages, but all lecture examples and homework solutions will be based on R. The course staff will only provide help on R. The use of Notebooks (R or Jupyter Notebook) will be strongly encouraged.</p>
<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>The course will have bi-weekly homework assignments (other than exam weeks). Six homework assignments are expected to be assigned (see course schedule for exact assignment dates).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Online submission via Canvas only. Students will be required to submit one or two files: one for the solutions of the all questions other than a programming question and the other for the solutions of the programming question. For the solutions of the non-programming questions, you may type your homework by LaTeX, Word, etc., or may scan your hand-written homework.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a typed work, mathematical notations need to be rendered properly in the submitted work. For example, final work needs to show $x^2$ instead of <code>x^2</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a handwritten work, students need to use the scanning app to scan the document. <strong>Please do not just take a picture of your work with your phone&rsquo;s camera</strong>. Work that is uploaded as an image straight from one&rsquo;s camera will not be graded (the image is usually too large to be properly loaded on Canvas).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No late homework will be accepted</strong>. Submission after the deadline will systematically be prevented by Canvas. Please try to submit the homework a few hours before the deadline and make sure that the homework is properly submitted to the Canvas before the submission is closed. <strong>It is a student&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that all work are properly submitted prior to the deadline</strong>. Late submission will be excused only if written documentation or email notice from university authority is provided for university-excused reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All homework will be graded <strong>based on the completion.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One homework with the lowest score will be dropped. Also, each student will be given one chance of homework extension.</strong> To use this chance, one should email to the instructor <strong>12 hours prior to the deadline of the homework</strong> and 72 hours of extension will be granted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be a bonus for submitting all assignments (with each score greater than or equal to 40). See Grades for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are welcomed to discuss homework problems with others, but the final work must be of individual effort. In other words, copying solutions from other students is not acceptable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-evaluation">Learning Evaluation</h2>
<h3 id="in-class-quizzes">In-Class Quizzes</h3>
<p>There will be <strong>six in-class quizzes</strong> (15 mins) on the next lecture after the due date of each homework. See Class Schedules for the exact dates. One selected question from the previous homework will be on the quiz. <strong>One lowest quiz score will be dropped.</strong></p>
<h3 id="short-questions-after-each-lecture">Short Questions after Each Lecture</h3>
<p>A short quiz question will be posted after each lecture. Each question will be designed to serve as a quick reminder of important concepts/material covered during the lecture. Each quiz will be due the following lecture. <strong>Will be graded based on the completion.</strong></p>
<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two (2) mid-term examinations</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterm 1: 2/26 (8:30AM-9:55AM; Location: Thomas Building 100)</li>
<li>Midterm 2: 3/31 (8:30AM-9:55AM; Location: Thomas Building 100)</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A distribution table will be provided at each exam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unexcused absences from an exam will result in a score of zero for that exam. No make-up exams will be provided except under extenuating circumstances with valid proofs and documentations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-communication">Class Communication</h2>
<h3 id="piazza-for-class-discussion">Piazza for Class Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will be using Piazza for class discussion. To facilitate collaborative learning experience, please ask all questions related to Statistics at Piazza. Piazza allows more interactive discussion between classmates or students and teaching staffs. Piazza also supports anonymous posting to peer (however note that posts are not anonymous to teaching staff).</li>

<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity—scholarship free of fraud and deception—is an important educational objective of Penn State. To learn more about academic integrity at Penn State, please visit the <a href="http://academicintegrity.psu.edu/">Penn State Academic
Integrity</a> site. Academic dishonesty can lead to a failing grade or referral to the <a href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/">Office of Student
Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copying</strong>: examples include a student looking at another student’s work during an exam, a student copying an assignment from another student, students exchanging color-coded exams for the purpose of copying.</li>
<li><strong>Improper Use of Technology:</strong> for example, a student possesses and/or uses a cell phone when one is not permitted; a student uses software or electronic aides such as calculators, computers, handheld devices, etc. when not permitted by the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitating Academic Dishonesty by Others:</strong> for example, a student permits another student to copy an exam or assignment; a student provides a completed assignment to another student and allows the student to submit it as his or her own; a student writes another student’s paper or completes another student’s assignment and then provides it to the student so they may receive credit; a student shares information about an exam with another student who has not taken the exam.</li>
<li><strong>Unauthorized Test Possession, Purchase, or Supplying:</strong> for example, when a student possesses an exam without the instructor’s permission; a student purchases or steals an exam; a student fails to return an exam which was requested to be returned; a student makes a copy of an exam; or sells an exam.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-academic-integrity-violations-are-handled">How Academic Integrity Violations Are Handled</h3>
<p>In cases where academic integrity is questioned, the <a href="http://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html">Policy on Academic Integrity</a> indicates that procedure requires an instructor to notify a student of suspected dishonesty before filing a charge and recommended sanction with the college. Procedures allow a student to accept or contest a charge. If a student chooses to contest a charge, the case will then be managed by the respective college or campus Academic Integrity Committee. If a disciplinary sanction also is recommended, the case will be referred to the <a href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/">Office of Student
